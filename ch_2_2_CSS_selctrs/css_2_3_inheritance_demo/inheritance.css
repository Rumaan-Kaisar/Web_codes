/* 
        Inheritance: some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.
        For example, if you set a color and font-family on an element, every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, 
        unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.


        Some properties do not inherit â€” for example, if you set a width of 50% on an element, 
        all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width. 
        If this was the case, CSS would be very frustrating to use! 

        So by default some property won't inherit from its p0arent, to force it to inherit, we use "inherit" value

                property: inherit;
