Which one of the following variables contains a valid boolean:
    let isHappy = 'true';
    let isHappy = True;
    let isHappy = true; 

    Correct: true


Which one of the following variable declarations follows JavaScript variable naming conventions?
    let high_score = 107;
    let high-score = 107;
    let HighScore = 107;
    let highScore = 107;

    Correct: highScore
    This variable name is camel-cased, with the first letter lowercased.


What is the value of "score" after the following code runs?
        let score = 5;
        score + 4;
    9
    4
    5

    Correct: 5
    We never update the value of score!


What is the value of bankBalance after the following code runs:   
        let bankBalance = 100;
        bankBalance /= 2;
        bankBalance += 10; 
    100
    50
    110
    60

    Correct: 60


What is the value of age after the following code runs?
        const age = 64;
        age++;
    65
    64
    63

    Correct: 64
    Line 2 results in an ERR, because we cannot reassign a 'const' variable. So age stays 64.
